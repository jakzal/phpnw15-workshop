# Loose coupling in practice (PHPNW 2015)

## Requirements

The only environment requirement is **PHP >= 5.5** with **PDO sqlite** support.

You'll also need **git** to clone the repository and save your progress
during the workshop.

## Setting up

Clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:jakzal/phpnw15-workshop.git
    cd phpnw15-workshop

Run the following setup command and make sure it finishes with **no errors**:

    php setup.php

It's safe to run it multiple times.

Please set it up as soon as possible, and let me know if there's any issues
(my e-mail can be found in `composer.json`).

A day before the workshop, please pull the latest version of the repository
and run the setup script again:

    git pull
    php setup.php
